Suppose the file with full path **path/to/file** has been deleted in a previous commit and we want it back

First we search for the last commit referring to the file
<code bash>
git rev-list -n 1 HEAD -- path/to/file
</code>
Then will return the hash code (say **<hash_code_commit>**) of the last commit referring to the file. It is the commit that has deleted the file. So we need to get it from the commit before using **^**
<code bash>
git checkout <hash_code_commit>^ -- path/to/file
</code>
This will restore the last version of the file at its original path.
