We want to create a git project from an existing code in the folder called **existing_dir**.
The local git is created with **init** and then we add all the files from existing_dir in the git repository and make the first commit :
<code bash>
cd existing_dir
git init
git add .     
git commit -m 'message'
</code>
Fill 'message' with an appropriate message , e.g. 'my first commit'

If you just want to add selected files, there are several ways to do it. You can create a **.gitignore** file with all the files and folders you don't want to manage with **git**. Another way is to add only to **git** some selected files, for example the Python files :
<code bash>
cd existing_dir
git init
git add *.py    
git commit -m 'message'
</code>

We can now push it to the web on your GitLab account. Here **user** should be replaced by your account name and **existing_dir** by the project name.

<code bash>
git push --set-upstream https://gitlab.com/user/existing_dir.git master
</code>

For ENSTA Bretagne's GitLab, the user is defined with the 6+2 id code (ex tournetr for Tryphon Tournesol). You will have to type the id and the password to complete the push. 

After that, you can check that the project has correctly been created on GitLab by typing the URL (https://gitlab.com/user/existing_dir.git) in a wEB browser :
