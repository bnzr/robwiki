Branch allows to develop or correct the project without impacting on the master

To create a new branch, e;g called **devel**, do:
<code bash>
git checkout -b devel
</code>
after this command you will be in **devel** branch. To change to an existing branch, just remove **-b**:
<code bash>
git checkout existing_branch
</code>
you are now in **existing_branch**.

To check the branch you are in, do: 
<code bash>
git branch
</code>

To list all branches (local and remote) use:
<code bash>
git branch -a
</code>
If instead of **-a**, you put **-l** you get only the local branches. With **-r**, you get only the remote branches. A more detailed list of branches with their status is given by:
<code bash>
git show-branch
</code>
