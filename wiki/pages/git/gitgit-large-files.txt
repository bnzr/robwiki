Sometimes when trying to clone repos with large file , a curl error can occur :
<code text>
Cloning into 'project'... error: RPC failed; HTTP 502 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 502 fatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly
</code>

Change the buffer size : 
<code bash>
git config http.postBuffer 524288000
</code>
and then set the origin ::
<code bash>
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/project.git
</code>
after that clone your project. Your problem should be resolved.
