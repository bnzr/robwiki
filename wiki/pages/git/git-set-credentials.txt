If you a tired to type your username and password each time you are making a push or a pull, you can save yours credentials (user and password) in the git config. This is done by pushing a repo (ex. repo.git of user owner) :
<code bash>
git config credential.helper store
git push https://github.com/owner/repo.git
</code>
You can give a timeout of for example 2 hours (7200s) : 
<code bash>
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout 7200'
</code>
After completion of the timeout, the credentials (user,password) are not recognized anymore.
