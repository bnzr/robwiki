Go to the path were you want to create the workspace

<code bash>
cd /path/to/workspace
</code>

Create the workspace, named **ws**, and the source folder called **src**
<code bash>
mkdir -p ws/src
cd ws
catkin_make
</code>

Additional folders have been created :
<code bash>
ls
build  devel  src
</code>

The content of the workspace has to be made available to ROS so that our new packages can be used in ROS.
Normally, there is no path to our new workspace :
<code bash>
echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
/opt/ros/melodic/share
</code>

After initialization, the path is updated and our packages will now be usable in ROS :
<code bash>
source devel/setup.bash
echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
/path/to/workspace/ws/src:/opt/ros/melodic/share
</code>
