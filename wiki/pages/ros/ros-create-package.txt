A new and empty ROS package can be created with catkin (http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage)
in the src folder of the workspace.
<code bash>
catkin_create_pkg <package_name> [depend1] [depend2] [depend3]
</code>
where depend1, depend2 and depend3 are the dependencies added at the creation of the package.


For example, to create a Python package called **my_pkg** in my ROS workspace **ws** :

<code bash>
cd /path/to/workspace/ws/src
catkin_create_pkg my_pkg std_msgs rospy 
</code>

For a C++ package add **roscpp** dependency.

To get access to this new package, we need to run again the setup.bash file
<code bash>
cd ..
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
</code>
