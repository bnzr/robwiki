====== Adding Sensors to SimulIDE ======


For electronic labs to run on simulation, SimulIDE can be a very convenient tool as it is fairly easy to add your own sensors with a fully controlled sensing function. You can add noise and all kind of sensing errors (accuracy, repeatability, hysteresis, resolution, etc.). The procedure to add a sensor in SimulIDE is described here for two kind of sensors : an analog resistive sensor and a digital I2C sensor :

* [[electro:simulide-sensors-analog|SimulIDE : add an analog resistive sensor]]

* [[electro:simulide-sensors-digital-i2c|SimulIDE : add an I2C digital sensor]]
